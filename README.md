## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm a Software Engineering BSc student from the University of Leicester.

I like to take a peek inside of the games I enjoy and make something of my own along the way.

I've been developing mods for Bloons TD 6, Stellaris and Minecraft, adding my own creative flair and a bit of silliness to these games. Additionally, I've created/recreated arcade-style games using Pyglet and Pygame and explored graphics programming through contributing to Pyglet itself. 

Python is my primary programming language, but I've adapted to working with many programming languages such as Java, C and C#, when they enable me to do something new.

The computer science society at UoL - [LeicesterCS](https://leicestercs.co.uk/) - has hosted hackathons that I've been keen to compete in. Check out the [SwapStuff](https://github.com/ZabirAbu/RecycleSharingSystem), an application that landed my team in the top 5! 5th place that is... there was some steep competition!
